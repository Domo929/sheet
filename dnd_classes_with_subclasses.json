      "Introduction": "Source: Eberron - Forge of the Artificer\nMasters of invention, Artificers use ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions.\n[TABLE 0]",
      "As a Level 1 Character": "Gain all the traits in the Core Artificer Traits table. Gain the Artificer’s level 1 features, which are listed in the Artificer Features table.",
      "As a Multiclass Character": "Gain the following traits from the Core Artificer Traits table: Hit Point Die, proficiency with Tinker’s Tools, proficiency in one skill of your choice from the Artificer’s skill list, and training with Light and Medium armor and Shields. Gain the Artificer’s level 1 features, which are listed in the Artificer Features table. See the multiclassing rules in the Player’s Handbook to determine your available spell slots, adding half your Artificer levels (round up).",
      "Artificer Class Features": "As an Artificer, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Artificer levels. These features are listed on the Artificer Features table.\n[TABLE 1]\n[TABLE 2]",
      "Level 1: Spellcasting": "You have learned how to channel magical energy through objects. See the Player’s Handbook for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Artificer spells, which appear in the Artificer Spell List\nTools Required. You produce your Artificer spells through tools. You can use Thieves’ Tools, Tinker’s Tools, or another kind of Artisan’s Tools with which you have proficiency as a Spellcasting Focus, and you must have one of those focuses in hand when you cast an Artificer spell (meaning the spell has an M component when you cast it).\nCantrips. You know two Artificer cantrips of your choice. Acid Splash and Prestidigitation are recommended.\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Artificer cantrip of your choice.\nWhen you reach Artificer levels 10 and 14, you learn another Artificer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Artificer Features table.\nSpell Slots. The Artificer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Artificer spells. Cure Wounds and Grease are recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Artificer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Artificer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Artificer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Artificer, your list of prepared spells can include six Artificer spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\nIf another Artificer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Artificer spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Artificer spells for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Artificer spells.",
      "Level 1: Tinker's Magic": "You know the Mending cantrip.\nAs a Magic action while holding Tinker’s Tools, you can create one item in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of yourself, choosing the item from the following list:\n[TABLE 3]\nSee the rules for the item in the Player’s Handbook. The item lasts until you finish a Long Rest, at which point it vanishes.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.",
      "Level 2: Replicate Magic Item": "You have learned arcane plans that you use to make magic items.\nPlans Known. When you gain this feature, choose four plans to learn from the Magic Item Plans (Artificer Level 2+) table. Bag of Holding , Cap of Water Breathing , Sending Stones , and Wand of the War Mage are recommended. Whenever you gain an Artificer level, you can replace one of the plans you know with a new plan for which you qualify.\nYou learn another plan of your choice when you reach certain Artificer levels, as shown in the Plans Known column of the Artificer Features table. When you choose a plan to learn, you choose it from any Magic Item Plans table for which you qualify; your qualification is based on your Artificer level.\nCreating an Item. When you finish a Long Rest, you can create one or two different magic items if you have Tinker’s Tools in hand. Each item is based on one of the plans you know for this feature.\nIf a created item requires Attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you create it. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for Attunement.\nWhen you reach certain Artificer levels specified in the Magic Items column of the Artificer Features table, the number of magic items you can create at the end of a Long Rest increases. Each item you create must be based on a different plan you know.\nYou can’t have more magic items from this feature than the number shown in the Magic Items column of the Artificer Features table for your level. If you try to exceed your maximum number of magic items for this feature, the oldest item vanishes, and then the new item appears.\nDuration. A magic item created by this feature functions as the normal magic item, except its magic isn’t permanent; when you die, the magic item vanishes after 1d4 days. If you replace a plan you know with a new plan, any magic item created with the replaced plan immediately vanishes.\nIf an item that you created with this feature is a container, such as a Bag of Holding, and it vanishes, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use any Wand or Weapon created by this feature as a Spellcasting Focus in lieu of using a set of Artisan’s Tools.\n[TABLE 4]\n[TABLE 5]\n[TABLE 6]\n[TABLE 7]",
      "Level 3: Artificer Subclass": "You gain an Artificer subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Artificer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Artificer level or lower.",
      "Artificer Subclasses": "[TABLE 8]",
      "Level 4: Ability Score Improvement": "You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Artificer levels 8, 12, and 16.",
      "Level 6: Magic Item Tinker": "Your Replicate Magic Item feature gains the following options.\nCharge Magic Item. As a Bonus Action, you can touch a magic item within 5 feet of yourself that you created with Replicate Magic Item and that uses charges. You expend a level 1+ spell slot and recharge the item. The number of charges the item regains is equal to the level of spell slot expended.\nDrain Magic Item. As a Bonus Action, you can touch a magic item within 5 feet of yourself that you created with Replicate Magic Item and cause the item to vanish, converting its magical energy into a spell slot. The slot is level 1 if the item is Common or level 2 if the item is Uncommon or Rare. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest.\nTransmute Magic Item. As a Magic action, you can touch one magic item within 5 feet of yourself that you created with Replicate Magic Item and transform it into a different magic item. The resulting item must be based on a magic item plan you know. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.",
      "Level 7: Flash of Genius": "When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you fails an ability check or a saving throw, you can take a Reaction to add a bonus to the roll, potentially causing it to succeed. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).\nYou can take this Reaction a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.",
      "Level 10: Magic Item Adept": "You can now attune to up to four magic items at once.",
      "Level 11: Spell-Storing Item": "Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can touch one Simple or Martial weapon or one item that you can use as a Spellcasting Focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a level 1, 2, or 3 Artificer spell that has a casting time of an action and doesn’t require a Material component that is consumed by the spell (you needn’t have the spell prepared).\nWhile holding the object, a creature can take a Magic action to produce the spell’s effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires Concentration, the creature must concentrate. Once a creature has used the object to produce the spell’s effect, the object can’t be used this way again until the start of the creature’s next turn.\nThe spell stays in the object until it’s been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.",
      "Level 14: Advanced Artifice": "You gain the following benefits.\nMagic Item Savant. You can now attune to up to five magic items at once.\nRefreshed Genius. When you finish a Short Rest, you regain one expended use of your Flash of Genius feature.",
      "Level 18: Magic Item Master": "You can now attune to up to six magic items at once.",
      "Level 19: Epic Boon": "You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Energy Resistance is recommended.",
      "Level 20: Soul of Artifice": "You have developed a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for aid. You gain the following benefits.\nCheat Death. If you’re reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, you can disintegrate any number of Uncommon or Rare magic items created by your Replicate Magic Item feature. If you do so, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to 20 times the number of magic items disintegrated.\nMagical Guidance. When you finish a Short Rest, you regain all expended uses of your Flash of Genius if you have Attunement to at least one magic item."

See the Player’s Handbook for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Artificer spells, which appear in the\nArtificer Spell List\nTools Required.\nYou produce your Artificer spells through tools. You can use Thieves’ Tools, Tinker’s Tools, or another kind of Artisan’s Tools with which you have proficiency as a Spellcasting Focus, and you must have one of those focuses in hand when you cast an Artificer spell (meaning the spell has an M component when you cast it).\nCantrips.\nYou know two Artificer cantrips of your choice.\nAcid Splash\nand\nPrestidigitation\nare recommended.\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Artificer cantrip of your choice.\nWhen you reach Artificer levels 10 and 14, you learn another Artificer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Artificer Features table.\nSpell Slots.\nThe Artificer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+.\nYou prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Artificer spells.\nCure Wounds\nand\nGrease\nare recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Artificer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Artificer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Artificer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Artificer, your list of prepared spells can include six Artificer spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\nIf another Artificer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Artificer spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells.\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Artificer spells for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability.\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Artificer spells.\nLevel 1: Tinker's Magic\nYou know the\nMending\ncantrip.\nAs a Magic action while holding Tinker’s Tools, you can create one item in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of yourself, choosing the item from the following list:\nBall Bearings\nFlask\nPouch\nBasket\nGrappling Hook\nRope\nBedroll\nHunting Trap\nSack\nBell\nJug\nShovel\nBlanket\nLamp\nSpikes, Iron\nBlock and Tackle\nManacles\nString\nBottle, Glass\nNet\nTinderbox\nBucket\nOil\nTorch\nCaltrops\nPaper\nVial\nCandle\nParchment\nCrowbar\nPole\nSee the rules for the item in the Player’s Handbook.

Whenever you gain an Artificer level, you can replace one of the plans you know with a new plan for which you qualify.\nYou learn another plan of your choice when you reach certain Artificer levels, as shown in the Plans Known column of the Artificer Features table. When you choose a plan to learn, you choose it from any Magic Item Plans table for which you qualify; your qualification is based on your Artificer level.\nCreating an Item.\nWhen you finish a Long Rest, you can create one or two different magic items if you have Tinker’s Tools in hand. Each item is based on one of the plans you know for this feature.\nIf a created item requires Attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you create it. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for Attunement.\nWhen you reach certain Artificer levels specified in the Magic Items column of the Artificer Features table, the number of magic items you can create at the end of a Long Rest increases. Each item you create must be based on a different plan you know.\nYou can’t have more magic items from this feature than the number shown in the Magic Items column of the Artificer Features table for your level. If you try to exceed your maximum number of magic items for this feature, the oldest item vanishes, and then the new item appears.\nDuration.\nA magic item created by this feature functions as the normal magic item, except its magic isn’t permanent; when you die, the magic item vanishes after 1d4 days. If you replace a plan you know with a new plan, any magic item created with the replaced plan immediately vanishes.\nIf an item that you created with this feature is a container, such as a Bag of Holding, and it vanishes, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.\nSpellcasting Focus.\nYou can use any Wand or Weapon created by this feature as a Spellcasting Focus in lieu of using a set of Artisan’s Tools.\nMagic Item Plans (Artificer Level 2+)\nMagic Item Plan\nAttunement\nAlchemy Jug\nNo\nBag of Holding\nNo\nCap of Water Breathing\nNo\nCommon magic item that isn’t a Potion, a Scroll, or cursed (you can learn this option multiple times and must select a different item each time; each item selected counts as a different plan)\nVaries\nGoggles of Night\nNo\nManifold Tool\nYes\nRepeating Shot\nYes\nReturning Weapon\nNo\nRope of Climbing\nNo\nSending Stones\nNo\nShield +1\nNo\nWand of Magic Detection\nNo\nWand of Secrets\nNo\nWand of the War Mage +1\nYes\nWeapon +1\nNo\nWraps of Unarmed Power +1\nNo\nMagic Item Plans (Artificer Level 6+)\nMagic Item Plan\nAttunement\nArmor +1\nNo\nBoots of Elvenkind\nNo\nBoots of the Winding Path\nYes\nCloak of Elvenkind\nYes\nCloak of the Manta Ray\nNo\nDazzling Weapon\nYes\nEyes of Charming\nYes\nEyes of Minute Seeing\nNo\nGloves of Thievery\nNo\nHelm of Awareness\nNo\nLantern of Revealing\nNo\nMind Sharpener\nYes\nNecklace of Adaption\nYes\nPipes of Haunting\nNo\nRepulsion Shield\nNo\nRing of Swimming\nNo\nRing of Water Walking\nNo\nSentinel Shield\nNo\nSpell-Refueling Ring\nYes\nWand of Magic Missiles\nNo\nWand of Web\nYes\nWeapon of Warning\nYes\nMagic Item Plans (Artificer Level 10+)\nMagic Item Plan\nAttunement\nArmor of Resistance\nYes\nDagger of Venom\nNo\nElven Chain\nNo\nRing of Feather Falling\nYes\nRing of Jumping\nYes\nRing of Mind Shielding\nYes\nShield +2\nNo\nUncommon Wondrous Item that isn’t cursed (you can learn this option multiple times and must select a different item each time; each item selected counts as a different plan)\nVaries\nWand of the War Mage +2\nYes\nWeapon +2\nNo\nWraps of Unarmed Power +2\nNo\nMagic Item Plans (Artificer Level 14+)\nMagic Item Plan\nAttunement\nArmor +2\nNo\nArrow-Catching Shield\nYes\nFlame Tongue\nYes\nRare Wondrous Item that isn’t cursed (you can learn this option multiple times and must select a different item each time; each item selected counts as a different plan)\nVaries\nRing of Free Action\nYes\nRing of Protection\nYes\nRing of the Ram\nYes\nLevel 3: Artificer Subclass\nYou gain an Artificer subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Artificer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Artificer level or lower.\nArtificer Subclasses\nName\nAlchemist\nArmorer\nArtillerist\nBattle Smith\nCartographer\nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement\nYou gain the\nAbility Score Improvement feat\nor another\nfeat of your choice\nfor which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Artificer levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 6: Magic Item Tinker\nYour Replicate Magic Item feature gains the following options.\nCharge Magic Item.\nAs a Bonus Action, you can touch a magic item within 5 feet of yourself that you created with Replicate Magic Item and that uses charges. You expend a level 1+ spell slot and recharge the item. The number of charges the item regains is equal to the level of spell slot expended.\nDrain Magic Item.\nAs a Bonus Action, you can touch a magic item within 5 feet of yourself that you created with Replicate Magic Item and cause the item to vanish, converting its magical energy into a spell slot. The slot is level 1 if the item is Common or level 2 if the item is Uncommon or Rare. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest.\nTransmute Magic Item.\nAs a Magic action, you can touch one magic item within 5 feet of yourself that you created with Replicate Magic Item and transform it into a different magic item. The resulting item must be based on a magic item plan you know. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 7: Flash of Genius\nWhen you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you fails an ability check or a saving throw, you can take a Reaction to add a bonus to the roll, potentially causing it to succeed.

More than a mere emotion—and not limited to anger—this Rage is an incarnation of a predator’s ferocity, a storm's fury, and a sea's turmoil.\nSome Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a connection to the pain and anguish of the world, as an impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression of their own deepest self. For every Barbarian, their Rage is a power that fuels not just battle prowess, but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses.\nBarbarians often serve as protectors and leaders in their communities. They charge headlong into danger so those under their protection don't have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes Barbarians perfectly suited for adventure.\n[TABLE 0]",

      "Level 1: Rage": "You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action if you aren't wearing Heavy armor.\nYou can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nWhile active, your Rage follows the rules below. Damage Resistance. You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.\nRage Damage. When you make an attack using Strength—with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike—and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.\nStrength Advantage. You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.\nNo Concentration or Spells. You can't maintain Concentration, and you can't cast spells.\nDuration. The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:\nMake an attack roll against an enemy. Force an enemy to make a saving throw. Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.\nEach time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.",
      "Level 1: Unarmored Defense": "While you aren't wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.",
      "Level 1: Weapon Mastery": "Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.\nWhen you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Barbarian Features table.",
      "Level 2: Danger Sense": "You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity saving throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition.",
      "Level 2: Reckless Attack": "You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage during that time.",
      "Level 3: Barbarian Subclass": "You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The Path of the Berserker, Path of the Wild Heart, Path of the World Tree, and Path of the Zealot subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Barbarian level or lower.\n[TABLE 2]",
      "Level 3: Primal Knowledge": "You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1.\nIn addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, or Survival. When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.",
      "Level 4: Ability Score Improvement": "You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.",

      "Level 7: Instinctive Pounce": "As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.",
      "Level 9: Brutal Strike": "If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Advantage on one Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn't have Disadvantage. If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice.\nYou have the following effect options.\nForceful Blow. The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking Opportunity Attacks.\nHamstring Blow. The target’s Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time— the most recent one.",
      "Level 11: Relentless Rage": "Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage is active and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.\nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long Rest, the DC resets to 10.",
      "Level 13: Improved Brutal Strike": "You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The following effects are now among your Brutal Strike options.\nStaggering Blow. The target has Disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t make Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next turn.\nSundering Blow. Before the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.",
      "Level 15: Persistent Rage": "When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nIn addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armor.",
      "Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike": "The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike feature.",
      "Level 18: Indomitable Might": "If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving throw is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.",
      "Level 19: Epic Boon": "You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Irresistible Offense is recommended.",

    "raw_text": "Source: Player's Handbook\nBarbarians are mighty warriors who are powered by primal forces of the multiverse that manifest as a Rage. More than a mere emotion—and not limited to anger—this Rage is an incarnation of a predator’s ferocity, a storm's fury, and a sea's turmoil.\nSome Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a connection to the pain and anguish of the world, as an impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression of their own deepest self. For every Barbarian, their Rage is a power that fuels not just battle prowess, but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses.\nBarbarians often serve as protectors and leaders in their communities. They charge headlong into danger so those under their protection don't have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes Barbarians perfectly suited for adventure.\nCore Barbarian Traits\nPrimary Ability\nStrength\nHit Point Die\nD12 per Barbarian level\nSaving Throw Proficiencies\nStrength and Constitution\nSkill Proficiencies\nChoose 2: Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, or Survival\nWeapon Proficiencies\nSimple and Martial weapons\nArmor Training\nLight and Medium armor and Shields\nStarting Equipment\nChoose A or B: (A) Greataxe, 4 Handaxes, Explorer’s Pack, and 15 GP; or (B) 75 GP\nBecoming a Barbarian …\nAs a Level 1 Character\nGain all the traits in the Core Barbarian Traits table.\nGain the Barbarian's level 1 features, which are listed in the Barbarian Features table.\nAs a Multiclass Character\nGain the following traits from the Core Barbarian Traits table: Hit Point Die, proficiency with Martial weapons, and training with Shields.\nGain the Barbarian's level 1 features, which are listed in the Barbarian Features table.\nBarbarian Class Features\nBarbarian Features\nLevel\nProficiency Bonus\nFeatures\nRages\nRage Damage\nWeapon Mastery\n1\n+2\nRage\n,\nUnarmored Defense\n,\nWeapon Mastery\n2\n+2\n2\n2\n+2\nDanger Sense\n,\nReckless Attack\n2\n+2\n2\n3\n+2\nBarbarian Subclass\n,\nPrimal Knowledge\n3\n+2\n2\n4\n+2\nAbility Score Improvement\n3\n+2\n3\n5\n+3\nExtra Attack\n,\nFast Movement\n3\n+2\n3\n6\n+3\nSubclass feature\n4\n+2\n3\n7\n+3\nFeral Instinct\n,\nInstinctive Pounce\n4\n+2\n3\n8\n+3\nAbility Score Improvement\n4\n+2\n3\n9\n+4\nBrutal Strike\n4\n+3\n3\n10\n+4\nSubclass feature\n4\n+3\n4\n11\n+4\nRelentless Rage\n4\n+3\n4\n12\n+4\nAbility Score Improvement\n5\n+3\n4\n13\n+5\nImproved Brutal Strike\n5\n+3\n4\n14\n+5\nSubclass feature\n5\n+3\n4\n15\n+5\nPersistent Rage\n5\n+3\n4\n16\n+5\nAbility Score Improvement\n5\n+4\n4\n17\n+6\nImproved Brutal Strike\n6\n+4\n4\n18\n+6\nIndomitable Might\n6\n+4\n4\n19\n+6\nEpic Boon\n6\n+4\n4\n20\n+6\nPrimal Champion\n6\n+4\n4\nAs a Barbarian, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Barbarian levels. These features are listed in the Barbarian Features table.\nLevel 1: Rage\nYou can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action if you aren't wearing Heavy armor.\nYou can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nWhile active, your Rage follows the rules below.\nDamage Resistance.\nYou have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.\nRage Damage.\nWhen you make an attack using Strength—with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike—and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.\nStrength Advantage.\nYou have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.\nNo Concentration or Spells.\nYou can't maintain Concentration, and you can't cast spells.\nDuration.\nThe Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:\nMake an attack roll against an enemy.\nForce an enemy to make a saving throw.\nTake a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.\nEach time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.\nLevel 1: Unarmored Defense\nWhile you aren't wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.\nLevel 1: Weapon Mastery\nYour training with weapons allows you to use the\nmastery properties\nof two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.\nWhen you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Barbarian Features table.\nLevel 2: Danger Sense\nYou gain an uncanny sense of when things aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity saving throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition.\nLevel 2: Reckless Attack\nYou can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage during that time.\nLevel 3: Barbarian Subclass\nYou gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The Path of the Berserker, Path of the Wild Heart, Path of the World Tree, and Path of the Zealot subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of\nyour Barbarian level or lower.\nBarbarian Subclasses\nName\nPath Of The Berserker\nPath Of The Wild Heart\nPath Of The World Tree\nPath Of The Zealot\nLevel 3: Primal Knowledge\nYou gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1.\nIn addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, or Survival. When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.\nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement\nYou gain the\nAbility Score Improvement feat\nor another\nfeat of your choice\nfor which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 5: Extra Attack\nYou can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nLevel 5: Fast Movement\nYour speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing Heavy armor.\nLevel 7: Feral Instinct\nYour instincts are so honed that you have Advantage on Initiative rolls.\nLevel 7: Instinctive Pounce\nAs part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.\nLevel 9: Brutal Strike\nIf you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Advantage on one Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn't have Disadvantage. If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice.\nYou have the following effect options.\nForceful Blow.\nThe target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking Opportunity Attacks.\nHamstring Blow.\nThe target’s Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time— the most recent one.\nLevel 11: Relentless Rage\nYour Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage is active and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.\nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long Rest, the DC resets to 10.\nLevel 13: Improved Brutal Strike\nYou have honed new ways to attack furiously. The following effects are now among your Brutal Strike options.\nStaggering Blow.\nThe target has Disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t make Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next turn.\nSundering Blow.\nBefore the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.\nLevel 15: Persistent Rage\nWhen you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nIn addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armor.\nLevel 17: Improved Brutal Strike\nThe extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike feature.\nLevel 18: Indomitable Might\nIf your total for a Strength check or Strength saving throw is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon\nYou gain an\nEpic Boon feat\nor another feat of your choice for which you qualify.\nBoon of Irresistible Offense\nis recommended.\nLevel 20: Primal Champion\nYou embody primal power. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.",

They become masters of many things, including performing music, working magic, and making jests.\nA Bard's life is spent traveling, gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer.

These features are listed in the Bard Features table.\nLevel 1: Bardic Inspiration\nYou can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.\nUsing Bardic Inspiration.\nAs a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.\nOnce within the next hour when the creature fails a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it's rolled.\nNumber of Uses.\nYou can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nAt Higher Levels.\nYour Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15.\nLevel 1: Spellcasting\nYou have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Bard spells, which appear in the\nBard spell list\nlater in the class's description.\nCantrips.\nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list.\nDancing Lights\nand\nVicious Mockery\nare recommended.\nWhenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list.\nWhen you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard Features table.\nSpell Slots.\nThe Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+.\nYou prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list.\nCharm Person\n,\nColor Spray\n,\nDissonant Whispers\n, and\nHealing Word\nare recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\nIf another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells.\nWhenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability.\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.\nSpellcasting Focus.\nYou can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.\nLevel 2: Expertise\nYou gain Expertise (see the rules glossary) in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Performance and Persuasion are recommended if you have proficiency in them.\nAt Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice.\nLevel 2: Jack of all Trades\nYou can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round down) to any ability check you make that uses a skill proficiency you lack and that doesn't otherwise use your Proficiency Bonus.\nFor example, if you make a Strength (Athletics) check and lack Athletics proficiency, you can add half your Proficiency Bonus to the check.\nLevel 3: Bard Subclass\nYou gain a Bard subclass of your choice. The College of Dance, College of Glamour, College of Lore, and College of Valor subclasses are detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Bard level or lower.\nBard Subclasses\nName\nCollege of Dance\nCollege of Glamour\nCollege of Lore\nCollege of the Moon\nCollege of Valor\nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement\nYou gain the\nAbility Score Improvement feat\nor another\nfeat of your choice\nfor which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Bard levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 5: Font of Inspiration\nYou now regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest.\nIn addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action required) to regain one expended use of Bardic Inspiration.\nLevel 7: Countercharm\nYou can use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened condition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to be rerolled, and the new roll has Advantage.\nLevel 10: Magical Secrets\nYou've learned secrets from various magical traditions. Whenever you reach a Bard level (including this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the Bard Features table increases, you can choose any of your new prepared spells from the\nBard\n,\nCleric\n,\nDruid\n, and\nWizard\nspell lists, and the chosen spells count as Bard spells for you (see a class’s section for its spell list). In addition, whenever you replace a spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with a spell from those lists.\nLevel 18: Superior Inspiration\nWhen you roll Initiative, you regain expended uses of Bardic Inspiration until you have two if you have fewer than that.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon\nYou gain an\nEpic Boon feat\nor another feat of your choice for which you qualify.\nBoon of Spell Recall\nis recommended.\nLevel 20: Words of Creation\nYou have mastered two of the Words of Creation: the words of life and death. You therefore always have the\nPower Word: Heal\nand\nPower Word: Kill\nspells prepared. When you cast either spell, you can target a second creature with it if that creature is within 10 feet of the first target.",

      "Introduction": "Source: Player's Handbook\nClerics draw power from the realms of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes—where gods dwell—and channel it to bolster people and battle foes.\nBecause their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked their magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the Outer Planes.\nNot every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many mortals claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.\n[TABLE 0]",

      "Cleric Class Features": "[TABLE 1]\n[TABLE 2]\nAs a Cleric, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Cleric levels. These features are listed in the Cleric Features table.",
      "Level 1: Spellcasting": "You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the Cleric spell list later in the class’s description.\nCantrips. You know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list. Guidance , Sacred Flame , and Thaumaturgy are recommended.\nWhenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list.\nWhen you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table.\nSpell Slots. The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list. Bless , Cure Wounds , Guiding Bolt , and Shield of Faith are recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\nIf another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.",

Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Heavy armor.\nThaumaturge. You know one extra cantrip from the Cleric spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).",
      "Level 2: Channel Divinity": "You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.\nYou can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features table.\nIf a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.\nDivine Spark. As a Magic action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).\nYou roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).\nTurn Undead. As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you die.",
      "Level 3: Cleric Subclass": "You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The Life Domain, Light Domain, Trickery Domain, and War Domain subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Cleric level or lower.\n[TABLE 3]",
      "Level 4: Ability Score Improvement": "You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8, 12, and 16.",

Each Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn effect.",
      "Level 7: Blessed Strikes": "Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice (if you get either option from a Cleric subclass in an older book, use only the option you choose for this feature).\nDivine Strike. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice).\nPotent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.",
      "Level 10: Divine Intervention": "You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a Magic action, choose any Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.",
      "Level 14: Improved Blessed Strikes": "The option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows more powerful.\nDivine Strike. The extra damage of your Divine Strike increases to 2d8.\nPotent Spellcasting. When you cast a Cleric cantrip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can give vitality to yourself or another creature within 60 feet of yourself, granting a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Wisdom modifier.",
      "Level 19: Epic Boon": "You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended.",
      "Level 20: Greater Divine Intervention": "You can call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention feature, you can choose Wish when you select a spell. If you do so, you can’t use Divine Intervention again until you finish 2d4 Long Rests."

    "raw_text": "Source: Player's Handbook\nClerics draw power from the realms of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes—where gods dwell—and channel it to bolster people and battle foes.\nBecause their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked their magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the Outer Planes.\nNot every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic.

These features are listed in the Cleric Features table.\nLevel 1: Spellcasting\nYou have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the\nCleric spell list\nlater in the class’s description.\nCantrips.\nYou know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list.\nGuidance\n,\nSacred Flame\n, and\nThaumaturgy\nare recommended.\nWhenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list.\nWhen you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table.\nSpell Slots.\nThe Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+.\nYou prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list.\nBless\n,\nCure Wounds\n,\nGuiding Bolt\n, and\nShield of Faith\nare recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\nIf another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells.\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability.\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.\nSpellcasting Focus.\nYou can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.\nLevel 1: Divine Order\nYou have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.\nProtector.\nTrained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Heavy armor.\nThaumaturge.\nYou know one extra cantrip from the Cleric spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).\nLevel 2: Channel Divinity\nYou can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.\nYou can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features table.\nIf a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.\nDivine Spark.\nAs a Magic action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).\nYou roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).\nTurn Undead.\nAs a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you die.\nLevel 3: Cleric Subclass\nYou gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The Life Domain, Light Domain, Trickery Domain, and War Domain subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Cleric level or lower.\nCleric Subclasses\nName\nKnowledge Domain\nLife Domain\nLight Domain\nTrickery Domain\nWar Domain\nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement\nYou gain the\nAbility Score Improvement feat\nor another\nfeat of your choice\nfor which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 5: Sear Undead\nWhenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn effect.\nLevel 7: Blessed Strikes\nDivine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice (if you get either option from a Cleric subclass in an older book, use only the option you choose for this feature).\nDivine Strike.\nOnce on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice).\nPotent Spellcasting.\nAdd your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.\nLevel 10: Divine Intervention\nYou can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a Magic action, choose any Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 14: Improved Blessed Strikes\nThe option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows more powerful.\nDivine Strike.\nThe extra damage of your Divine Strike increases to 2d8.\nPotent Spellcasting.\nWhen you cast a Cleric cantrip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can give vitality to yourself or another creature within 60 feet of yourself, granting a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Wisdom modifier.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon\nYou gain an\nEpic Boon feat\nor another feat of your choice for which you qualify.\nBoon of Fate\nis recommended.\nLevel 20: Greater Divine Intervention\nYou can call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention feature, you can choose\nWish\nwhen you select a spell. If you do so, you can’t use Divine Intervention again until you finish 2d4 Long Rests.",

Clerics who wield this power are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their deities’ discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.\nThe Light Domain is associated with gods of truth, vigilance, beauty, insight, and renewal. Some of these gods are identified with the sun or as charioteers who guide the sun across the sky. Others are sentinels who pierce deception.

      "Introduction": "Source: Player's Handbook\nDruids belong to ancient orders that call on the forces of nature. Harnessing the magic of animals, plants, and the four elements, Druids heal, transform into animals, and wield elemental destruction.\nRevering nature above all, individual Druids gain their magic from nature, a nature deity, or both, and they typically unite with other Druids to perform rites that mark the passage of the seasons and other natural cycles.\nDruids are concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life and with the need for people to live in harmony with nature. Druids often guard sacred sites or watch over regions of unspoiled nature, but when a significant danger arises, Druids take a more active role as adventurers who combat the threat.\n[TABLE 0]",
      "As a Level 1 Druid": "Gain all the traits in the Core Druid Traits table. Gain the Druid’s level 1 features, which are listed in the Druid Features table.",
      "As a Multiclass Druid": "Gain the following traits from the Core Druid Traits table: Hit Point Die and training with Light armor and Shields. Gain the Druid’s level 1 features, which are listed in the Druid Features table. See the multiclassing rules in multiclassing to determine your available spell slots.",
      "Druid Class Features": "[TABLE 1]\n[TABLE 2]\nAs a Druid, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Druid levels. These features are listed in the Druid Features table.",
      "Level 1: Spellcasting": "You have learned to cast spells through studying the mystical forces of nature. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the Druid spell list later in the class’s description.\nCantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. Druidcraft and Produce Flame are recommended.\nWhenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list .\nWhen you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table.\nSpell Slots. The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list. Animal Friendship , Cure Wounds , Faerie Fire , and Thunderwave are recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\nIf another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.",
      "Level 1: Druidic": "You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals; you always have the Speak with Animals spell prepared.\nYou can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check but can’t decipher it without magic.",
      "Level 1: Primal Order": "You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.\nMagician. You know one extra cantrip from the Druid spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1).\nWarden. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor.",
      "Level 2: Wild Shape": "The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.\nNumber of Uses. You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nYou gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table.\nKnown Forms. You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see appendix B for stat block options). The Rat, Riding Horse, Spider, and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.\nWhen you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.\nWhen choosing known forms, you may look in the Monster Manual or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so.\n[TABLE 3]\nRules While Shape-Shifted. While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:\nTemporary Hit Points. When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level.\nGame Statistics. Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast’s stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast’s stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.\nNo Spellcasting. You can’t cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn’t break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast.\nObjects. Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form’s limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it’s practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you’re in that form.",
      "Level 2: Wild Companion": "You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid you. As a Magic action, you can expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the Find Familiar spell without Material components.\nWhen you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is Fey and disappears when you finish a Long Rest.",
      "Level 3: Druid Subclass": "You gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The Circle of the Land, Circle of the Moon, Circle of the Sea, and Circle of the Stars subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Druid level or lower.\n[TABLE 4]",
      "Level 4: Ability Score Improvement": "You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels 8, 12, and 16.",
      "Level 5: Wild Resurgence": "Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required).\nIn addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape (no action required) to give yourself a level 1 spell slot, but you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.",
      "Level 7: Elemental Fury": "The might of the elements flows through you. You gain one of the following options of your choice.\nPotent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Druid cantrip.\nPrimal Strike. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or a Beast form’s attack in Wild Shape, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you hit).",
      "Level 15: Improved Elemental Fury": "The option you chose for Elemental Fury grows more powerful, as detailed below.\nPotent Spellcasting. When you cast a Druid cantrip with a range of 10 feet or greater, the spell’s range increases by 300 feet.\nPrimal Strike. The extra damage of your Primal Strike increases to 2d8.",
      "Level 18: Beast Spells": "While using Wild Shape, you can cast spells in Beast form, except for any spell that has a Material component with a cost specified or that consumes its Material component.",
      "Level 19: Epic Boon": "You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended.",
      "Level 20: Archdruid": "The vitality of nature constantly blooms within you, granting you the following benefits.\nEvergreen Wild Shape. Whenever you roll Initiative and have no uses of Wild Shape left, you regain one expended use of it.\nNature Magician. You can convert uses of Wild Shape into a spell slot (no action required). Choose a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape and convert them into a single spell slot, with each use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if you convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level 4 spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLongevity. The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every ten years that pass, your body ages only one year."

    "raw_text": "Source: Player's Handbook\nDruids belong to ancient orders that call on the forces of nature. Harnessing the magic of animals, plants, and the four elements, Druids heal, transform into animals, and wield elemental destruction.\nRevering nature above all, individual Druids gain their magic from nature, a nature deity, or both, and they typically unite with other Druids to perform rites that mark the passage of the seasons and other natural cycles.\nDruids are concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life and with the need for people to live in harmony with nature. Druids often guard sacred sites or watch over regions of unspoiled nature, but when a significant danger arises, Druids take a more active role as adventurers who combat the threat.\nCore Druid Traits\nPrimary Ability\nWisdom\nHit Point Die\nD8 per Druid level\nSaving Throw Proficiencies\nIntelligence and Wisdom\nSkill Proficiencies\nChoose 2: Arcana, Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, or Survival\nWeapon Proficiencies\nSimple weapons\nTool Proficiencies\nHerbalism Kit\nArmor Training\nLight armor and Shields\nStarting Equipment\nChoose A or B: (A) Leather Armor, Shield, Sickle, Druidic Focus (Quarterstaff), Explorer's Pack, Herbalism Kit, and 9 GP; or (B) 50 GP\nAs a Level 1 Druid\nGain all the traits in the Core Druid Traits table.\nGain the Druid’s level 1 features, which are listed in the Druid Features table.\nAs a Multiclass Druid\nGain the following traits from the Core Druid Traits table: Hit Point Die and training with Light armor and Shields.\nGain the Druid’s level 1 features, which are listed in the Druid Features table.

These features are listed in the Druid Features table.\nLevel 1: Spellcasting\nYou have learned to cast spells through studying the mystical forces of nature. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the\nDruid spell list\nlater in the class’s description.\nCantrips.\nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list.\nDruidcraft\nand\nProduce Flame\nare recommended.\nWhenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the\nDruid spell list\n.\nWhen you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table.\nSpell Slots.\nThe Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+.\nYou prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list.\nAnimal Friendship\n,\nCure Wounds\n,\nFaerie Fire\n, and\nThunderwave\nare recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\nIf another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells.\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability.\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.\nSpellcasting Focus.\nYou can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.\nLevel 1: Druidic\nYou know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals; you always have the\nSpeak with Animals\nspell prepared.\nYou can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check but can’t decipher it without magic.\nLevel 1: Primal Order\nYou have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.\nMagician.\nYou know one extra cantrip from the Druid spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1).\nWarden.\nTrained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor.\nLevel 2: Wild Shape\nThe power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.\nNumber of Uses.\nYou can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nYou gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table.\nKnown Forms.\nYou know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see appendix B for stat block options). The Rat, Riding Horse, Spider, and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.\nWhen you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.\nWhen choosing known forms, you may look in the Monster Manual or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so.\nDruid Level\nKnown Forms\nMax CR\nFly Speed\n2\n4\n1/4\nNo\n4\n6\n1/2\nNo\n8\n8\n1\nYes\nRules While Shape-Shifted.\nWhile in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:\nTemporary Hit Points.\nWhen you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level.\nGame Statistics.\nYour game statistics are replaced by the Beast’s stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast’s stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.\nNo Spellcasting.\nYou can’t cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn’t break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast.\nObjects.\nYour ability to handle objects is determined by the form’s limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it’s practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you’re in that form.\nLevel 2: Wild Companion\nYou can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid you. As a Magic action, you can expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the\nFind Familiar\nspell without Material components.\nWhen you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is Fey and disappears when you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 3: Druid Subclass\nYou gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The Circle of the Land, Circle of the Moon, Circle of the Sea, and Circle of the Stars subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Druid level or lower.\nDruid Subclasses\nName\nCircle of the Land\nCircle of the Moon\nCircle of the Sea\nCircle of the Stars\nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement\nYou gain the\nAbility Score Improvement feat\nor another\nfeat of your choice\nfor which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 5: Wild Resurgence\nOnce on each of your turns, if you have no uses of Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required).\nIn addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape (no action required) to give yourself a level 1 spell slot, but you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 7: Elemental Fury\nThe might of the elements flows through you. You gain one of the following options of your choice.\nPotent Spellcasting.\nAdd your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Druid cantrip.\nPrimal Strike.\nOnce on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or a Beast form’s attack in Wild Shape, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you hit).\nLevel 15: Improved Elemental Fury\nThe option you chose for Elemental Fury grows more powerful, as detailed below.\nPotent Spellcasting.\nWhen you cast a Druid cantrip with a range of 10 feet or greater, the spell’s range increases by 300 feet.\nPrimal Strike.\nThe extra damage of your Primal Strike increases to 2d8.\nLevel 18: Beast Spells\nWhile using Wild Shape, you can cast spells in Beast form, except for any spell that has a Material component with a cost specified or that consumes its Material component.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon\nYou gain an\nEpic Boon feat\nor another feat of your choice for which you qualify.\nBoon of Dimensional Travel\nis recommended.\nLevel 20: Archdruid\nThe vitality of nature constantly blooms within you, granting you the following benefits.\nEvergreen Wild Shape.\nWhenever you roll Initiative and have no uses of Wild Shape left, you regain one expended use of it.\nNature Magician.\nYou can convert uses of Wild Shape into a spell slot (no action required). Choose a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape and convert them into a single spell slot, with each use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if you convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level 4 spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLongevity.\nThe primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every ten years that pass, your body ages only one year.",

          "Level 6: Natural Recovery": "You can cast one of the level 1+ spells that you have prepared from your Circle Spells feature without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you do so again.\nIn addition, when you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Druid level (round up), and none of them can be level 6+. For example, if you’re a level 6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels’ worth of spell slots.

They last there for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition or die. You and your allies have Half Cover while in that area, and your allies gain the current Resistance of your Nature’s Ward while there.\nAs a Bonus Action, you can move the Cube up to 60 feet to ground within 120 feet of yourself."

These Druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of their communities.\nLevel 3: Circle of the Land Spells\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, choose one type of land: arid, polar, temperate, or tropical.

Vitality-giving flowers and life-draining thorns appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point. Each creature of your choice in the Sphere must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. One creature of your choice in that area regains 2d6 Hit Points.\nThe damage and healing increase by 1d6 when you reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6).\nLevel 6: Natural Recovery\nYou can cast one of the level 1+ spells that you have prepared from your Circle Spells feature without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you do so again.\nIn addition, when you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Druid level (round up), and none of them can be level 6+. For example, if you’re a level 6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels’ worth of spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level 2 and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell slots. Once you recover spell slots with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 10: Nature’s Ward\nYou are immune to the Poisoned condition, and you have Resistance to a damage type associated with your current land choice in the Circle Spells feature, as shown in the Nature’s Ward table.\nNature's Ward\nLand Type\nResistance\nArid\nFire\nPolar\nCold\nTemperate\nLightning\nTropical\nPoison\nLevel 14: Nature’s Sanctuary\nAs a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and cause spectral trees and vines to appear in a 15-foot Cube on the ground within 120 feet of yourself. They last there for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition or die. You and your allies have Half Cover while in that area, and your allies gain the current Resistance of your Nature’s Ward while there.\nAs a Bonus Action, you can move the Cube up to 60 feet to ground within 120 feet of yourself."

When you activate this form and as a Bonus Action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of yourself. On a hit, the attack deals Radiant damage equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier.\nChalice.\nA constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores Hit Points to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier.\nDragon.\nA constellation of a wise dragon appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.\nLevel 6: Cosmic Omen\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can consult your Star Map for omens and roll a die. Until you finish your next Long Rest, you gain access to a special Reaction based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die:\nWeal (Even).\nWhenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a D20 Test, you can take a Reaction to roll 1d6 and add the number rolled to the total.\nWoe (Odd).\nWhenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a D20 Test, you can take a Reaction to roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the total.\nYou can use this Reaction a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 10: Twinkling Constellations\nThe constellations of your Starry Form improve. The 1d8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes 2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a Fly Speed of 20 feet and can hover.\nMoreover, at the start of each of your turns while in your Starry Form, you can change which constellation glimmers on your body.\nLevel 14: Full of Stars\nWhile in your Starry Form, you become partially incorporeal, giving you Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage."

Their spells both complement and extend their combat skills, providing additional protection to shore up their armor and also allowing them to engage many foes at once with explosive magic.\nLevel 3: Spellcasting\nYou have learned to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as an Eldritch Knight.\nCantrips.\nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the\nWizard spell list\n(see that class’s section for its list).\nRay of Frost\nand\nShocking Grasp\nare recommended. Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Wizard spell list.\nWhen you reach Fighter level 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.\nSpell Slots.\nThe Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+.\nYou prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 spells from the\nWizard spell list\n.\nBurning Hands\n,\nJump\n, and\nShield\nare recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Fighter levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Wizard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 7 Fighter, your list of prepared spells can include five Wizard spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells.\nWhenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Wizard spell for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability.\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.\nSpellcasting Focus.\nYou can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.\nEldritch Knight Spellcasting\nFighter Level\nPrepared Spells\n1st\n2nd\n3rd\n4th\n3\n3\n2\n-\n-\n-\n4\n4\n3\n-\n-\n-\n5\n4\n3\n-\n-\n-\n6\n4\n3\n-\n-\n-\n7\n5\n4\n2\n-\n-\n8\n6\n4\n2\n-\n-\n9\n6\n4\n2\n-\n-\n10\n7\n4\n3\n-\n-\n11\n8\n4\n3\n-\n-\n12\n8\n4\n3\n-\n-\n13\n9\n4\n3\n2\n-\n14\n10\n4\n3\n2\n-\n15\n10\n4\n3\n2\n-\n16\n11\n4\n3\n3\n-\n17\n11\n4\n3\n3\n-\n18\n11\n4\n3\n3\n-\n19\n12\n4\n3\n3\n1\n20\n13\n4\n3\n3\n1\nLevel 3: War Bond\nYou learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a Short Rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond. The bond fails if another Fighter is bonded to the weapon or if the weapon is a magic item to which someone else is attuned.\nOnce you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can’t be disarmed of that weapon unless you have the Incapacitated condition. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a Bonus Action, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.\nYou can have up to two bonded weapons, but you can summon only one at a time with a Bonus Action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.\nLevel 7: War Magic\nWhen you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with a casting of one of your Wizard cantrips that has a casting time of an action.\nLevel 10: Eldritch Strike\nYou learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature’s ability to withstand your spells. When you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, that creature has Disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.\nLevel 15: Arcane Charge\nWhen you use your Action Surge, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can teleport before or after the additional action.\nLevel 18: Improved War Magic\nWhen you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace two of the attacks with a casting of one of your level 1 or level 2 Wizard spells that has a casting time of an action."

      "Introduction": "Source: Player's Handbook\nMonks use rigorous combat training and mental discipline to align themselves with the multiverse and focus their internal reservoirs of power. Different Monks conceptualize this power in various ways: as breath, energy, life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether channeled as a striking display of martial prowess or as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does.\nMonks focus their internal power to create extraordinary, even supernatural, effects. They channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or without the use of weapons. In a Monk’s hands, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated implements of combat mastery.\nMany Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and mental focus they need to harness their power. Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination and discipline.\nMonks generally view adventures as tests of their physical and mental development. They are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering treasure; they strive to turn themselves into living weapons.\n[TABLE 0]",

    "raw_text": "Source: Player's Handbook\nMonks use rigorous combat training and mental discipline to align themselves with the multiverse and focus their internal reservoirs of power. Different Monks conceptualize this power in various ways: as breath, energy, life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether channeled as a striking display of martial prowess or as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does.\nMonks focus their internal power to create extraordinary, even supernatural, effects. They channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or without the use of weapons. In a Monk’s hands, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated implements of combat mastery.\nMany Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and mental focus they need to harness their power. Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination and discipline.\nMonks generally view adventures as tests of their physical and mental development. They are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering treasure; they strive to turn themselves into living weapons.\nCore Monk Traits\nPrimary Ability\nDexterity and Wisdom\nHit Point Die\nD8 per Monk level\nSaving Throw Proficiencies\nStrength and Dexterity\nSkill Proficiencies\nChoose 2: Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, or Stealth\nTool Proficiencies\nChoose one type of Artisan's Tools or Musical Instrument\nWeapon Proficiencies\nSimple weapons and Martial weapons that have the Light property\nArmor Training\nNone\nStarting Equipment\nChoose A or B: (A) Spear, 5 Daggers, Artisan's Tools or Musical Instrument chosen for the tool proficiency above, Explorer's Pack and 11 GP; or (B) 50 GP\nBecoming a Monk…\nAs a Level 1 Character\nGain all the traits in the Core Monk Traits table.\nGain the Monk’s level 1 features, which are listed in the Monk Features table.\nAs a Multiclass Monk\nGain the Hit Point Die trait from the Core Monk Traits table.\nGain the Monk’s level 1 features, which are listed in the Monk Features table.\nMonk Class Features\nMonk Features (Part A)\nLevel\nProficiency Bonus\nClass Features\n1\n+2\nMartial Arts\n,\nUnarmored Defense\n2\n+2\nMonk's Focus\n,\nUnarmored Movement\n,\nUncanny Metabolism\n3\n+2\nDeflect Attacks\n,\nMonk Subclass\n4\n+2\nAbility Score Improvement\n,\nSlow Fall\n5\n+3\nExtra Attack\n,\nStunning Strike\n6\n+3\nEmpowered Strikes\n,\nSubclass Feature\n7\n+3\nEvasion\n8\n+3\nAbility Score Improvement\n9\n+4\nAcrobatic Movement\n10\n+4\nHeightened Focus\n,\nSelf-Restoration\n11\n+4\nSubclass Feature\n12\n+4\nAbility Score Improvement\n13\n+5\nDeflect Energy\n14\n+5\nDisciplined Survivor\n15\n+5\nPerfect Focus\n16\n+5\nAbility Score Improvement\n17\n+6\nSubclass Feature\n18\n+6\nSuperior Defense\n19\n+6\nEpic Boon\n20\n+6\nBody and Mind\nMonk Features (Part B)\nLevel\nMartial Arts\nFocus Points\nUnarmored Movement\n1\n1d6\n-\n-\n2\n1d6\n2\n+10 ft\n3\n1d6\n3\n+10 ft\n4\n1d6\n4\n+10 ft\n5\n1d8\n5\n+10 ft\n6\n1d8\n6\n+15 ft\n7\n1d8\n7\n+15 ft\n8\n1d8\n8\n+15 ft\n9\n1d8\n9\n+15 ft\n10\n1d8\n10\n+20 ft\n11\n1d10\n11\n+20 ft\n12\n1d10\n12\n+20 ft\n13\n1d10\n13\n+20 ft\n14\n1d10\n14\n+25 ft\n15\n1d10\n15\n+25 ft\n16\n1d10\n16\n+25 ft\n17\n1d12\n17\n+25 ft\n18\n1d12\n18\n+30 ft\n19\n1d12\n19\n+30 ft\n20\n1d12\n20\n+30 ft\nAs a Monk, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Monk levels. These features are listed in the Monk Features table.\nLevel 1: Martial Arts\nYour practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use your Unarmed Strike and Monk weapons, which are the following:\nSimple Melee weapons\nMartial Melee weapons that have the Light property\nYou gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only Monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield.\nBonus Unarmed Strike.\nYou can make an Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action.\nMartial Arts Die.\nYou can roll 1d6 in place of the normal damage of your Unarmed Strike or Monk weapons. This die changes as you gain Monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk Features table.\nDexterous Attacks.\nYou can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed Strikes and Monk weapons. In addition, when you use the Grapple or Shove option of your Unarmed Strike, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to determine the save DC.\nLevel 1: Unarmored Defense\nWhile you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers.\nLevel 2: Monk’s Focus\nYour focus and martial training allow you to harness a well of extraordinary energy within yourself. This energy is represented by Focus Points. Your Monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the Monk Features table.\nYou can expend these points to enhance or fuel certain Monk features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind, each of which is detailed below.\nWhen you expend a Focus Point, it is unavailable until you finish a Short or Long Rest, at the end of which you regain all your expended points.\nSome features that use Focus Points require your target to make a saving throw. The save DC equals 8 plus your Wisdom modifier and Proficiency Bonus.\nFlurry of Blows.\nYou can expend 1 Focus Point to make two Unarmed Strikes as a Bonus Action.\nPatient Defense.\nYou can take the Disengage action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Focus Point to take both the Disengage and the Dodge actions as a Bonus Action.\nStep of the Wind.\nYou can take the Dash action as a Bonus Action.

This bonus increases when you reach certain Monk levels, as shown on the Monk Features table.\nLevel 2: Uncanny Metabolism\nWhen you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended Focus Points. When you do so, roll your Martial Arts die, and regain a number of Hit Points equal to your Monk level plus the number rolled.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 3: Deflect Attacks\nWhen an attack roll hits you and its damage includes Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can take a Reaction to reduce the attack’s total damage against you. The reduction equals 1d10 plus your Dexterity modifier and Monk level.\nIf you reduce the damage to 0, you can expend 1 Focus Point to redirect some of the attack’s force. If you do so, choose a creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself if the attack was a melee attack or a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself that isn’t behind Total Cover if the attack was a ranged attack. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die plus your Dexterity modifier. The damage is the same type dealt by the attack.\nLevel 3: Monk Subclass\nYou gain a Monk subclass of your choice. The Warrior of Mercy, Warrior of Shadow, Warrior of the Elements, and Warrior of the Open Hand subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Monk levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Monk level or lower.\nMonk Subclasses\nName\nWarrior of Mercy\nWarrior of Shadow\nWarrior of the Elements\nWarrior of the Open Hand\nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement\nYou gain the\nAbility Score Improvement feat\nor another\nfeat of your choice\nfor which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Monk levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 4: Slow Fall\nYou can take a Reaction when you fall to reduce any damage you take from the fall by an amount equal to five times your Monk level.\nLevel 5: Extra Attack\nYou can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nLevel 5: Stunning Strike\nOnce per turn when you hit a creature with a Monk weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can expend 1 Focus Point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Stunned condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target’s Speed is halved until the start of your next turn, and the next attack roll made against the target before then has Advantage.\nLevel 6: Empowered Strikes\nWhenever you deal damage with your Unarmed Strike, it can deal your choice of Force damage or its normal damage type.\nLevel 7: Evasion\nWhen you’re subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail.\nYou don’t benefit from this feature if you have the Incapacitated condition.\nLevel 9: Acrobatic Movement\nWhile you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the movement.\nLevel 10: Heightened Focus\nYour Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind gain the following benefits.\nFlurry of Blows.\nYou can expend 1 Focus Point to use Flurry of Blows and make three Unarmed Strikes with it instead of two.\nPatient Defense.\nWhen you expend a Focus Point to use Patient Defense, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.\nStep of the Wind.\nWhen you expend a Focus Point to use Step of the Wind, you can choose a willing creature within 5 feet of yourself that is Large or smaller. You move the creature with you until the end of your turn. The creature’s movement doesn’t provoke Opportunity Attacks.\nLevel 10: Self-Restoration\nThrough sheer force of will, you can remove one of the following conditions from yourself at the end of each of your turns: Charmed, Frightened, or Poisoned.\nIn addition, forgoing food and drink doesn’t give you levels of Exhaustion.\nLevel 13: Deflect Energy\nYou can now use your Deflect Attacks feature against attacks that deal any damage type, not just Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing.\nLevel 14: Disciplined Survivor\nYour physical and mental discipline grant you proficiency in all saving throws.\nAdditionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can expend 1 Focus Point to reroll it, and you must use the new roll.\nLevel 15: Perfect Focus\nWhen you roll Initiative and don’t use Uncanny Metabolism, you regain expended Focus Points until you have 4 if you have 3 or fewer.\nLevel 18: Superior Defense\nAt the start of your turn, you can expend 3 Focus Points to bolster yourself against harm for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition. During that time, you have Resistance to all damage except Force damage.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon\nYou gain an\nEpic Boon feat\nor another feat of your choice for which you qualify.\nBoon of Irresistible Offense\nis recommended.\nLevel 20: Body and Mind\nYou have developed your body and mind to new heights. Your Dexterity and Wisdom scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.",

The damage type is your choice of Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.\nEmpowered Strikes.\nOnce on each of your turns, you can deal extra damage to a target equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die when you hit it with an Unarmed Strike.

      "Introduction": "Source: Player's Handbook\nPaladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of annihilation and corruption. Whether sworn before a god's altar, in a sacred glade before nature spirits or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a Paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion. Paladins train to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the injured, smite their foes, and protect the helpless and those who fight at their side. Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the world's armies, but even fewer can claim the calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, these blessed folk turn from their former occupations and take up arms and magic.\n[TABLE 0]",
      "As a Level 1 Character": "Gain all the traits in the Core Paladin Traits table. Gain the Paladin's level 1 features, which are listed in the Paladin Features table.",
      "As a Multiclass Character": "Gain the following traits from the Core Paladin Traits table: Hit Point Die, proficiency with Martial weapons, and training with Light and Medium armor and Shields. Gain the Paladin's level 1 features, which are listed in the Paladin Features table. See the multiclassing rules in multiclassing to determine your available spell slots.",
      "Paladin Class Features": "[TABLE 1]\n[TABLE 2]\nAs a Paladin, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Paladin levels. These features are listed in the Paladin Features table.",
      "Level 1: Lay On Hands": "Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a Long Rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level.\nAs a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.\nYou can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the Poisoned condition from the creature; those points don't also restore Hit Points to the creature.",
      "Level 1: Spellcasting": "You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See Chapter 7 for the rules on Spellcasting. The Information below details how you use those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the Paladin spell list later in the class's description.\nSpell Slots. The Paladin Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells. Heroism and Searing Smite are recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Paladin spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\nIf another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.",
      "Level 1: Weapon Mastery": "Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins.\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For Example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails.",
      "Level 2: Fighting Style": "You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see chapter 5). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.\nBlessed Warrior. You learn two Cleric cantrips of your choice (See the Cleric class's section for a list of Cleric spells). Guidance and Sacred Flame are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Cleric cantrip.",
      "Level 2: Paladin's Smite": "You always have the Divine Smite spell prepared. You can cast it without expending a spell slot, but you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it this way again.",
      "Level 3: Channel Divinity": "You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class's Channel Divinity, you choose which effect from this class to create.\nYou can use this class's Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level 11.\nIf a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class's Spellcasting Feature.\nDivine Sense. As a Bonus Action, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.",
      "Level 3: Paladin Subclass": "You gain a Paladin Subclass of your choice. The Oath of Devotion, Oath of Glory, Oath of the Ancients and Oath of Vengeance subclasses are detailed after this class's description. A Subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Paladin level or lower.\n[TABLE 3]",
      "Breaking Your Oath": "A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible. Sometimes a Paladin transgresses on their oath.\nA Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh.\nIf your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath, talk to your DM. Your Paladin should probably take a more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class and adopt another one.",
      "Level 4: Ability Score Improvement": "You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Paladin levels 8, 12, and 16.",
      "Level 5: Extra Attack": "You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.",
      "Level 5: Faithful Steed": "You can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You always have the Find Steed spell prepared.\nYou can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain your ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest.",
      "Level 6: Aura of Protection": "You radiate a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot Emanation that originates from you. The aura is inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition.\nYou and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum bonus of +1).\nIf another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the creature chooses which aura while in them.",
      "Level 9: Abjure Foes": "As a Magic action, you can expend one use of this class's Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon, you can target a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While Frightened in this way, a target can only do one of the following on its turns: move, take an action or take a Bonus Action.",
      "Level 10: Aura of Courage": "You and your allies have Immunity to the Frightened condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Frightened ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on that ally while there.",
      "Level 11: Radiant Strikes": "Your strikes now carry supernatural power. When you hit a target with an attack roll using a Melee weapon or an Unarmed Strike, the target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage.",
      "Level 14: Restoring Touch": "When you use Lay On Hands on a creature, you can also remove one or more of the following conditions from the creature: Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Frightened, Paralyzed, or Stunned. You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool of Lay On Hands for each of these conditions you remove; those points don't also restore Hit Points to the creature.",
      "Level 18: Aura Expansion": "Your Aura of Protection is now a 30-foot Emanation.",
      "Level 19: Epic Boon": "You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Truesight is recommended."

    "raw_text": "Source: Player's Handbook\nPaladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of annihilation and corruption. Whether sworn before a god's altar, in a sacred glade before nature spirits or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a Paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.\nPaladins train to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the injured, smite their foes, and protect the helpless and those who fight at their side.\nAlmost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the world's armies, but even fewer can claim the calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, these blessed folk turn from their former occupations and take up arms and magic.\nCore Paladin Traits\nPrimary Ability\nStrength and Charisma\nHit Point Die\nD10 per Paladin level\nSaving Throw Proficiencies\nWisdom and Charisma\nSkill Proficiencies\nChoose 2: Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, or Religion\nWeapon Proficiencies\nSimple and Martial weapons\nArmor Training\nLight, Medium and Heavy armor and Shields\nStarting Equipment\nChoose A or B: (A) Chain Mail, Shield, Longsword, 6 Javelins, Holy Symbol, Priest's Pack and 9 GP; or (B) 150 GP\nBecoming a Paladin …\nAs a Level 1 Character\nGain all the traits in the Core Paladin Traits table.\nGain the Paladin's level 1 features, which are listed in the Paladin Features table.\nAs a Multiclass Character\nGain the following traits from the Core Paladin Traits table: Hit Point Die, proficiency with Martial weapons, and training with Light and Medium armor and Shields.\nGain the Paladin's level 1 features, which are listed in the Paladin Features table.

These features are listed in the Paladin Features table.\nLevel 1: Lay On Hands\nYour blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a Long Rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level.\nAs a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.\nYou can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the Poisoned condition from the creature; those points don't also restore Hit Points to the creature.\nLevel 1: Spellcasting\nYou have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See Chapter 7 for the rules on Spellcasting. The Information below details how you use those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the\nPaladin spell list\nlater in the class's description.\nSpell Slots.\nThe Paladin Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+.\nYou prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells.\nHeroism\nand\nSearing Smite\nare recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Paladin spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\nIf another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells.\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability.\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.\nSpellcasting Focus.\nYou can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.\nLevel 1: Weapon Mastery\nYour training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins.\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For Example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails.\nLevel 2: Fighting Style\nYou gain a\nFighting Style feat\nof your choice (see chapter 5). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.\nBlessed Warrior.\nYou learn two Cleric cantrips of your choice (See the Cleric class's section for a list of Cleric spells).\nGuidance\nand\nSacred Flame\nare recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Cleric cantrip.\nLevel 2: Paladin's Smite\nYou always have the\nDivine Smite\nspell prepared.\nYou can cast it without expending a spell slot, but you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it this way again.\nLevel 3: Channel Divinity\nYou can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class's Channel Divinity, you choose which effect from this class to create.\nYou can use this class's Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level 11.\nIf a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class's Spellcasting Feature.\nDivine Sense.\nAs a Bonus Action, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the\nHallow\nspell.\nLevel 3: Paladin Subclass\nYou gain a Paladin Subclass of your choice. The Oath of Devotion, Oath of Glory, Oath of the Ancients and Oath of Vengeance subclasses are detailed after this class's description. A Subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Paladin level or lower.\nPaladin Subclasses\nName\nOath of Devotion\nOath of Glory\nOath of the Ancients\nOath of the Noble Genies\nOath of Vengeance\nBreaking Your Oath\nA Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible. Sometimes a Paladin transgresses on their oath.\nA Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh.\nIf your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath, talk to your DM. Your Paladin should probably take a more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class and adopt another one.\nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement\nYou gain the\nAbility Score Improvement feat\nor another\nfeat of your choice\nfor which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Paladin levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 5: Extra Attack\nYou can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nLevel 5: Faithful Steed\nYou can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed.\nYou always have the\nFind Steed\nspell prepared.\nYou can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain your ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 6: Aura of Protection\nYou radiate a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot Emanation that originates from you. The aura is inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition.\nYou and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum bonus of +1).\nIf another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the creature chooses which aura while in them.\nLevel 9: Abjure Foes\nAs a Magic action, you can expend one use of this class's Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon, you can target a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While Frightened in this way, a target can only do one of the following on its turns: move, take an action or take a Bonus Action.\nLevel 10: Aura of Courage\nYou and your allies have Immunity to the Frightened condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Frightened ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on that ally while there.\nLevel 11: Radiant Strikes\nYour strikes now carry supernatural power. When you hit a target with an attack roll using a Melee weapon or an Unarmed Strike, the target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage.\nLevel 14: Restoring Touch\nWhen you use Lay On Hands on a creature, you can also remove one or more of the following conditions from the creature: Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Frightened, Paralyzed, or Stunned. You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool of Lay On Hands for each of these conditions you remove; those points don't also restore Hit Points to the creature.\nLevel 18: Aura Expansion\nYour Aura of Protection is now a 30-foot Emanation.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon\nYou gain an\nEpic Boon feat\nor another feat of your choice for which you qualify.\nBoon of Truesight\nis recommended.",

Mind Sliver and Minor Illusion are recommended.\nWhenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one of your cantrips, except Mage Hand , with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.\nWhen you reach Rogue level 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.\nSpell Slots.

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare a list of the level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 Wizard spells.

Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 7 Rogue, your list of prepared spells can include five Wizard spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Wizard spell for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability.

The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell's effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least level 1 and of a level you can cast (it doesn't need to be a Wizard spell).

Some Arcane Tricksters use their talents as pickpockets and burglars, while others are pranksters.\nLevel 3: Spellcasting\nYou have learned to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as an Arcane Trickster.\nCantrips.\nYou know three cantrips:\nMage Hand\nand two other cantrips of your choice from the\nWizard spell list\n(See that class's section for its list).\nMind Sliver\nand\nMinor Illusion\nare recommended.\nWhenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one of your cantrips, except\nMage Hand\n, with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.\nWhen you reach Rogue level 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.\nSpell Slots.\nThe Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+.\nYou prepare a list of the level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 Wizard spells.\nCharm Person\n,\nDisguise Self\nand\nFog Cloud\nare recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 7 Rogue, your list of prepared spells can include five Wizard spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells.\nWhenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Wizard spell for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability.\nIntelligence is your Spellcasting ability for your Wizard Spells.\nSpellcasting Focus.\nYou can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard Spells.\nArcane Trickster Spellcasting\nRogue Level\nPrepared Spells\n1st\n2nd\n3rd\n4th\n3\n3\n2\n-\n-\n-\n4\n4\n3\n-\n-\n-\n5\n4\n3\n-\n-\n-\n6\n4\n3\n-\n-\n-\n7\n5\n4\n2\n-\n-\n8\n6\n4\n2\n-\n-\n9\n6\n4\n2\n-\n-\n10\n7\n4\n3\n-\n-\n11\n8\n4\n3\n-\n-\n12\n8\n4\n3\n-\n-\n13\n9\n4\n3\n2\n-\n14\n10\n4\n3\n2\n-\n15\n10\n4\n3\n2\n-\n16\n11\n4\n3\n3\n-\n17\n11\n4\n3\n3\n-\n18\n11\n4\n3\n3\n-\n19\n12\n4\n3\n3\n1\n20\n13\n4\n3\n3\n1\nLevel 3: Mage Hand Legerdemain\nWhen you cast\nMage Hand\n, you can cast it as a Bonus Action, and you can make the spectral hand Invisible. You can control the hand as a Bonus Action, and through it, you can make Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks.\nLevel 9: Magical Ambush\nIf you have the Invisible condition when you cast a spell on a creature, it has Disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell on the same turn.\nLevel 13: Versatile Trickster\nYou gain the ability to distract targets with your\nMage Hand\n. When you use the Trip option of your Cunning Strike on a creature, you can also use that option on another creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand.\nLevel 17: Spell Thief\nYou gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.\nImmediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can take a Reaction to force the creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell's effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least level 1 and of a level you can cast (it doesn't need to be a Wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you have the spell prepared. The creature can't cast it until 8 hours have passed.\nOnce you steal a spell with this feature, you can't use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest."

      "Introduction": "Source: Player's Handbook\nSorcerers wield innate magic that is stamped into their being. Some Sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their personal or family history. The blessing of a dragon or a dryad at a baby’s birth or the strike of lightning from a clear sky might spark a Sorcerer’s gift. So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin, the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a churning magic that can be passed down through generations.\nSorcerers don’t learn magic; the raw, roiling power of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect its source.\nSorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People who have this magical power soon discover that it doesn’t like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded.\n[TABLE 0]",

      "Level 1: Spellcasting": "Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the Sorcerer spell list later in the class’s description.\nCantrips. You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. Light , Prestidigitation , Shocking Grasp , and Sorcerous Burst are recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.\nWhen you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table.\nSpell Slots. The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. Burning Hands and Detect Magic are recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.\nIf another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability.

You have Advantage on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast.\nYou can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.",
      "Level 2: Font of Magic": "You can tap into the wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.\nYou have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer Features table. You can’t have more Sorcery Points than the number shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a Long Rest.\nYou can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as Metamagic, that use those points.\nConverting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points.

You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that it costs.\nYou can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options.\nWhenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don’t know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.",
      "Level 3: Sorcerer Subclass": "You gain a Sorcerer subclass of your choice. The Aberrant Sorcery, Clockwork Sorcery, Draconic Sorcery, and Wild Magic Sorcery subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Sorcerer level or lower.\n[TABLE 3]",
      "Level 4: Ability Score Improvement": "You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Sorcerer levels 8, 12, and 16.",
      "Level 5: Sorcerous Restoration": "When you finish a Short Rest, you can regain expended Sorcery Points, but no more than a number equal to half your Sorcerer level (round down). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.",
      "Level 7: Sorcery Incarnate": "If you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take the Bonus Action to activate it.\nIn addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use up to two of your Metamagic options on each spell you cast.",

The blessing of a dragon or a dryad at a baby’s birth or the strike of lightning from a clear sky might spark a Sorcerer’s gift. So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin, the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a churning magic that can be passed down through generations.\nSorcerers don’t learn magic; the raw, roiling power of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect its source.\nSorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People who have this magical power soon discover that it doesn’t like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded.\nCore Sorcerer Traits\nPrimary Ability\nCharisma\nHit Point Die\nD6 per Sorcerer level\nSaving Throw Proficiencies\nConstitution and Charisma\nSkill Proficiencies\nChoose 2: Arcana, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Persuasion, or Religion\nWeapon Proficiencies\nSimple weapons\nArmor Training\nNone\nStarting Equipment\nChoose A or B: (A) Spear, 2 Daggers, Arcane Focus (crystal), Dungeoneer's Pack, and 28 GP; or (B) 50 GP\nBecoming a Sorcerer …\nAs a Level 1 Character\nGain all the traits in the Core Sorcerer Traits table.\nGain the Sorcerer's level 1 features, which are listed in the Sorcerer Features table.\nAs a Multiclass Character\nGain the Hit Point Die from the Core Sorcerer Traits table.\nGain the Sorcerer's level 1 features, which are listed in the Sorcerer Features table.

These features are listed in the Sorcerer Features table.\nLevel 1: Spellcasting\nDrawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the\nSorcerer spell list\nlater in the class’s description.\nCantrips.\nYou know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice.\nLight\n,\nPrestidigitation\n,\nShocking Grasp\n, and\nSorcerous Burst\nare recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.\nWhen you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table.\nSpell Slots.\nThe Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+.\nYou prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells.\nBurning Hands\nand\nDetect Magic\nare recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.\nIf another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells.\nWhenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability.\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.\nSpellcasting Focus.\nYou can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.\nLevel 1: Innate Sorcery\nAn event in your past left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus Action, you can unleash that magic for 1 minute, during which you gain the following benefits:\nThe spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells increases by 1.\nYou have Advantage on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast.\nYou can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 2: Font of Magic\nYou can tap into the wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.\nYou have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer Features table. You can’t have more Sorcery Points than the number shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a Long Rest.\nYou can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as Metamagic, that use those points.\nConverting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points.\nYou can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery Points equal to the slot’s level (no action required).\nCreating Spell Slots.\nAs a Bonus Action, you can transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than level 5.\nAny spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest.\nCreating Spell Slots\nSpell Slot Level\nSorcery Point Cost\nMin. Sorcerer Level\n1\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n3\n5\n5\n4\n6\n7\n5\n7\n9\nLevel 2: Metamagic\nBecause your magic flows from within, you can alter your spells to suit your needs; you gain two Metamagic options of your choice from “\nMetamagic Options\n” later in this class’s description. You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that it costs.\nYou can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options.\nWhenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your\nMetamagic\noptions with one you don’t know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.\nLevel 3: Sorcerer Subclass\nYou gain a Sorcerer subclass of your choice. The Aberrant Sorcery, Clockwork Sorcery, Draconic Sorcery, and Wild Magic Sorcery subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Sorcerer level or lower.\nSorcerer Subclasses\nName\nAberrant Sorcery\nClockwork Sorcery\nDraconic Sorcery\nSpellfire Sorcery\nWild Magic Sorcery\nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement\nYou gain the\nAbility Score Improvement feat\nor another\nfeat of your choice\nfor which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Sorcerer levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 5: Sorcerous Restoration\nWhen you finish a Short Rest, you can regain expended Sorcery Points, but no more than a number equal to half your Sorcerer level (round down). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 7: Sorcery Incarnate\nIf you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take the Bonus Action to activate it.\nIn addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use up to two of your\nMetamagic\noptions on each spell you cast.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon\nYou gain an\nEpic Boon feat\nor another feat of your choice for which you qualify.\nBoon of Dimensional Travel\nis recommended.\nLevel 20: Arcane Apotheosis\nWhile your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use one\nMetamagic\noption on each of your turns without spending Sorcery Points on it.",

        "raw_text": "Source: Player's Handbook\nChannel Cosmic Forces of Order\nThe cosmic force of order has suffused you with magic. That power arises from Mechanus or a realm like it—a plane of existence shaped entirely by clockwork efficiency. You or someone from your lineage might have become entangled in the machinations of modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit Mechanus. Perhaps your ancestor even took part in the Great Modron March. Whatever its origin within you, the power of order can seem strange to others, but for you, it’s part of a vast and glorious system.\nLevel 3: Clockwork Spells\nWhen you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Clockwork Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.\nClockwork Spells\nSorcerer Level\nSpells\n3\nAid\n,\nAlarm\n,\nLesser Restoration\n,\nProtection from Evil and Good\n5\nDispel Magic\n,\nProtection from Energy\n7\nFreedom of Movement\n,\nSummon Construct\n9\nGreater Restoration\n,\nWall of Force\nIn addition, consult the Manifestations of Order table and choose or randomly determine a way your connection to order manifests while you are casting any of your Sorcerer spells.\nManifestations of Order\n1d6\nManifestation\n1\nSpectral cogwheels hover behind you.\n2\nThe hands of a clock spin in your eyes.\n3\nYour skin glows with a brassy sheen.\n4\nFloating equations and geometric objects overlay your body.\n5\nYour Spellcasting Focus temporarily takes the form of a Tiny clockwork mechanism.\n6\nThe ticking of gears or ringing of a clock can be heard by you and those affected by your magic.\nLevel 3: Restore Balance\nYour connection to the plane of absolute order allows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself is about to roll a d20 with Advantage or Disadvantage, you can take a Reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by Advantage and Disadvantage.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 6: Bastion of Law\nYou can tap into the grand equation of existence to imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of order. As a Magic action, you can expend 1 to 5 Sorcery Points to create a magical ward around yourself or another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The ward is represented by a number of d8s equal to the number of Sorcery Points spent to create it. When the warded creature takes damage, it can expend a number of those dice, roll them, and reduce the damage taken by the total rolled on those dice.\nThe ward lasts until you finish a Long Rest or until you use this feature again.\nLevel 14: Trance of Order\nYou gain the ability to align your consciousness with the endless calculations of Mechanus. As a Bonus Action, you can enter this state for 1 minute. For the duration, attack rolls against you can’t benefit from Advantage, and whenever you make a D20 Test, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 5 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.\nLevel 18: Clockwork Cavalcade\nYou momentarily summon spirits of order to expunge disorder around you. As a Magic action, you summon the spirits in a 30-foot Cube originating from you. The spirits look like modrons or other Constructs of your choice. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and they create the effects below within the Cube before vanishing. Once you use this action, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 7 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.\nHeal.\nThe spirits restore up to 100 Hit Points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures of your choice in the Cube.\nRepair.\nAny damaged objects entirely in the Cube are repaired instantly.\nDispel.\nEvery spell of level 6 and lower ends on creatures and objects of your choice in the Cube."

        "raw_text": "Source: Player's Handbook\nUnleash Chaotic Magic\nYour innate magic stems from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You or an ancestor might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo or the Elemental Planes. Perhaps you were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke with no apparent cause. Whatever its source, this magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.\nLevel 3: Wild Magic Surge\nYour spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, you can roll 1d20 immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot. If you roll a 20, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect.\nIf the magical effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic.\nLevel 3: Tides of Chaos\nYou can manipulate chaos itself to give yourself Advantage on one D20 Test before you roll the d20. Once you do so, you must cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot or finish a Long Rest before you can use this feature again.\nIf you do cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot before you finish a Long Rest, you automatically roll on the Wild Magic Surge table.\nLevel 6: Bend Luck\nYou have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. Immediately after another creature you can see rolls the d20 for a D20 Test, you can take a Reaction and spend 1 Sorcery Point to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the d20 roll.\nLevel 14: Controlled Chaos\nYou gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either number.\nLevel 18: Tamed Surge\nImmediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot, you can create an effect of your choice from the Wild Magic Surge table instead of rolling on that table. You can choose any effect in the table except for the final row, and if the chosen effect involves a roll, you must make it.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nWild Magic Surge\n1d100\nEffect\n01-04\nRoll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.\n05-08\nA creature that is Friendly toward you appears in a random unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. The creature is under the DM’s control and disappears 1 minute later. Roll 1d4 to determine the creature: on a 1, a Modron Duodrone appears; on a 2, a Flumph appears; on a 3, a Modron Monodrone appears; on a 4, a Unicorn appears. See the Monster Manual for the creature’s stat block.\n09-12\nFor the next minute, you regain 5 Hit Points at the start of each of your turns.\n13-16\nCreatures have Disadvantage on saving throws against the next spell you cast in the next minute that involves a saving throw.\n17-20\nYou are subjected to an effect that lasts for 1 minute unless its description says otherwise. Roll 1d8 to determine the effect: on a 1, you’re surrounded by faint, ethereal music only you and creatures within 5 feet of you can hear; on a 2, your size increases by one size category; on a 3, you grow a long beard made of feathers that remains until you sneeze, at which point the feathers explode from your face and vanish; on a 4, you must shout when you speak; on a 5, illusory butterflies flutter in the air within 10 feet of you; on a 6, an eye appears on your forehead, granting you Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks; on an 7, pink bubbles float out of your mouth whenever you speak; on an 8, your skin turns a vibrant shade of blue for 24 hours or until the effect is ended by a\nRemove Curse\nspell.\n21-24\nFor the next minute, all your spells with a casting time of an action have a casting time of a Bonus Action.\n25-28\nYou are transported to the Astral Plane until the end of your next turn. You then return to the space you previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.\n29-32\nThe next time you cast a spell that deals damage within the next minute, don’t roll the spell’s damage dice for the damage. Instead use the highest number possible for each damage die.\n33-36\nYou have Resistance to all damage for the next minute.\n37-40\nYou turn into a potted plant until the start of your next turn. While you’re a plant, you have the Incapacitated condition and have Vulnerability to all damage. If you drop to 0 Hit Points, your pot breaks, and your form reverts.\n41-44\nFor the next minute, you can teleport up to 20 feet as a Bonus Action on each of your turns.\n45-48\nYou and up to three creatures you choose within 30 feet of you have the Invisible condition for 1 minute. This invisibility ends on a creature immediately after it makes an attack roll, deals damage, or casts a spell.\n49-52\nA spectral shield hovers near you for the next minute, granting you a +2 bonus to AC and immunity to\nMagic Missile\n.\n53-56\nYou can take one extra action on this turn.\n57-60\nYou cast a random spell. If the spell normally requires Concentration, it doesn’t require Concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration. Roll 1d10 to determine the spell: on a 1,\nConfusion\n; on a 2,\nFireball\n; on a 3,\nFog Cloud\n; on a 4,\nFly\n(cast on a random creature within 60 feet of you), on a 5,\nGrease\n; on a 6,\nLevitate\n(cast on yourself); on a 7,\nMagic Missile\n(cast as a level 5 spell); on an 8,\nMirror Image\n; on a 9,\nPolymorph\n(cast on yourself), and if you fail the saving throw, you turn into a Goat (see appendix B); on a 10,\nSee Invisibility\n.\n61-64\nFor the next minute, any flammable, nonmagical object you touch that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature bursts into flame, takes 1d4 Fire damage, and is burning.\n65-68\nIf you die within the next hour, you immediately revive as if by the\nReincarnate\nspell.\n69-72\nYou have the Frightened condition until the end of your next turn. The DM determines the source of your fear.\n73-76\nYou teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.\n77-80\nA random creature within 60 feet of you has the Poisoned condition for 1d4 hours.\n81-84\nYou radiate Bright Light in a 30-foot radius for the next minute. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you has the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn.\n85-88\nUp to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you take 1d10 Necrotic damage. You regain Hit Points equal to the sum of the Necrotic damage dealt.\n89-92\nUp to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you take 4d10 Lightning damage.\n93-96\nYou and all creatures within 30 feet of you have Vulnerability to Piercing damage for the next minute.\n97-00\nRoll 1d6: On a 1, you regain 2d10 Hit Points; on a 2, one ally of your choice within 300 feet of you regains 2d10 Hit Points; on a 3, you regain your lowest-level expended spell slot; on a 4, one ally of your choice within 300 feet of you regains their lowest-level expended spell slot; on a 5, you regain all your expended Sorcery Points; on a 6, all the effects of row 17–20 affect you simultaneously."

      "Introduction": "Source: Player's Handbook\nWarlocks quest for knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. They often begin their search for magical power by delving into tomes of forbidden lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the power of extraplanar beings, or seeking places of power where the influence of these beings can be felt. In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a binding pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as angels, archfey, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.\nWarlocks view their patrons as resources, as means to the end of achieving magical power. Some Warlocks respect, revere, or even love their patrons; some serve their patrons grudgingly; and some seek to undermine their patrons even as they wield the power their patrons have given them.\nOnce a pact is made, a Warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study. Most Warlocks spend their days pursuing greater power and deeper knowledge, which typically means some kind of adventure.\n[TABLE 0]",
      "As a Level 1 Character": "Gain all the traits in the Core Warlock Traits table. Gain the Warlock's level 1 features, which are listed in the Warlock Features table.",
      "As a Multiclass Character": "Gain the following traits from the Core Warlock Traits table: Hit Point Die and training with Light Armor. Gain the Warlock's level 1 features, which are listed in the Warlock Features table. See the multiclassing rules in multiclassing to determine your available spell slots.",
      "Warlock Class Features": "[TABLE 1]\n[TABLE 2]\nAs a Warlock, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Warlock levels. These features are listed in the Warlock Features table.",
      "Level 1: Eldritch Invocations": "You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations , pieces of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You gain one invocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome. Invocations are described in the “Eldritch Invocation Options” section later in this class’s description.\nPrerequisites. If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5.\nReplacing and Gaining Invocations. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a prerequisite for another invocation that you have.\nWhen you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table.\nYou can’t pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise.",
      "Level 1: Pact Magic": "Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the Warlock spell list later in the class’s description.\nCantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.\nWhen you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.\nSpell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.\nFor example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell Witch Bolt , you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. Charm Person and Hex are recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1–3.\nIf another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.\nSpellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.",
      "Level 2: Magical Cunning": "You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.",
      "Level 3: Warlock Subclass": "You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The Archfey Patron, Celestial Patron, Fiend Patron, and Great Old One Patron subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Warlock level or lower.\n[TABLE 3]",
      "Level 4: Ability Score Improvement": "You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels 8, 12, and 16.",
      "Level 9: Contact Patron": "In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the Contact Other Plane spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s saving throw.\nOnce you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest.",
      "Level 11: Mystic Arcanum": "Your patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this arcanum.\nYou can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again.\nAs shown in the Warlock Features table, you gain another Warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9 spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a Long Rest.\nWhenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level.",
      "Level 19: Epic Boon": "You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended.",
      "Level 20: Eldritch Master": "When you use your Magical Cunning feature, you regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots."

    "raw_text": "Source: Player's Handbook\nWarlocks quest for knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. They often begin their search for magical power by delving into tomes of forbidden lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the power of extraplanar beings, or seeking places of power where the influence of these beings can be felt. In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a binding pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as angels, archfey, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.\nWarlocks view their patrons as resources, as means to the end of achieving magical power. Some Warlocks respect, revere, or even love their patrons; some serve their patrons grudgingly; and some seek to undermine their patrons even as they wield the power their patrons have given them.\nOnce a pact is made, a Warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study. Most Warlocks spend their days pursuing greater power and deeper knowledge, which typically means some kind of adventure.\nCore Warlock Traits\nPrimary Ability\nCharisma\nHit Point Die\nD8 per Warlock level\nSaving Throw Proficiencies\nWisdom and Charisma\nSkill Proficiencies\nChoose 2: Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, or Religion\nWeapon Proficiencies\nSimple Weapons\nArmor Training\nLight armor\nStarting Equipment\nChoose A or B: (A) Leather Armor, Sickle, 2 Daggers, Arcane Focus (orb), Book (occult lore), Scholar's Pack and 15 GP; or (B) 100 GP\nBecoming a Warlock …\nAs a Level 1 Character\nGain all the traits in the Core Warlock Traits table.\nGain the Warlock's level 1 features, which are listed in the Warlock Features table.\nAs a Multiclass Character\nGain the following traits from the Core Warlock Traits table: Hit Point Die and training with Light Armor.\nGain the Warlock's level 1 features, which are listed in the Warlock Features table.

These features are listed in the Warlock Features table.\nLevel 1: Eldritch Invocations\nYou have unearthed\nEldritch Invocations\n, pieces of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You gain one invocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome. Invocations are described in the “Eldritch Invocation Options” section later in this class’s description.\nPrerequisites.\nIf an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5.\nReplacing and Gaining Invocations.\nWhenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a prerequisite for another invocation that you have.\nWhen you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table.\nYou can’t pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise.\nLevel 1: Pact Magic\nThrough occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the\nWarlock spell list\nlater in the class’s description.\nCantrips.\nYou know two Warlock cantrips of your choice.\nEldritch Blast\nand\nPrestidigitation\nare recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.\nWhen you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.\nSpell Slots.\nThe Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.\nFor example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell\nWitch Bolt\n, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+.\nYou prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells.\nCharm Person\nand\nHex\nare recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1–3.\nIf another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells.\nWhenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.\nSpellcasting Ability.\nCharisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.\nSpellcasting Focus.\nYou can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.\nLevel 2: Magical Cunning\nYou can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 3: Warlock Subclass\nYou gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The Archfey Patron, Celestial Patron, Fiend Patron, and Great Old One Patron subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Warlock level or lower.\nWarlock Subclasses\nName\nArchfey Patron\nCelestial Patron\nFiend Patron\nGreat Old One Patron\nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement\nYou gain the\nAbility Score Improvement feat\nor another\nfeat of your choice\nfor which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 9: Contact Patron\nIn the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the\nContact Other Plane\nspell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s saving throw.\nOnce you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 11: Mystic Arcanum\nYour patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this arcanum.\nYou can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again.\nAs shown in the Warlock Features table, you gain another Warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9 spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a Long Rest.\nWhenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon\nYou gain an\nEpic Boon feat\nor another feat of your choice for which you qualify.\nBoon of Fate\nis recommended.\nLevel 20: Eldritch Master\nWhen you use your Magical Cunning feature, you regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots.",

Immediately after you teleport, you or one creature you can see within 10 feet of yourself gains 1d10 Temporary Hit Points.\nTaunting Step.

On a failed save, the attacker takes Psychic damage equal to the damage you take. Once you use this Reaction, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.",
          "Level 14: Bewitching Magic": "Your patron grants you the ability to weave your magic with teleportation. Immediately after you cast an Enchantment or Illusion spell using an action and a spell slot, you can cast Misty Step as part of the same action and without expending a spell slot."

      "Introduction": "Source: Player's Handbook\nWizards are defined by their exhaustive study of magic's inner workings. They cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.\nMost Wizards share a scholarly approach to magic. They examine the theoretical underpinnings of magic, particularly the categorization of spells into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built on their studies to invent iconic spells now used across the multiverse.\nThe closest a Wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.\nBut the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.\n[TABLE 0]",

      "Wizard Class Features": "[TABLE 1]\nAs a Wizard, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Wizard levels. These features are listed in the Wizard Features table.",
      "Level 1: Spellcasting": "As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the Wizard spell list later in the class’s description.\nCantrips. You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. Light, Mage Hand, and Ray of Frost are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.\nWhen you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table.\nSpellbook. Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting Identify. You determine the book’s appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.\nThe book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. Detect Magic , Feather Fall , Mage Armor , Magic Missile , Sleep , and Thunderwave are recommended.\nWhenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.\nSpell Slots. The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.\nIf another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.\nSpellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.\nThe spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you might find other spells during your adventures that you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a Spell Scroll, for example, and then copy it into your spellbook.\nWhen you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it’s of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook.\nYou can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell.\nIf you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook.",
      "Level 1: Ritual Adept": "You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn’t have the spell prepared, but you must read from the book to cast a spell in this way.",
      "Level 1: Arcane Recovery": "You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if you're a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels’ worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.",
      "Level 2: Scholar": "While studying magic, you also specialized in another field of study. Choose one of the following skills in which you have proficiency: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion. You have Expertise in the chosen skill.",
      "Level 3: Arcane Tradition": "You gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. The Abjurer, Diviner, Evoker, and Illusionist subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Wizard level or lower.\n[TABLE 2]",
      "Level 4: Ability Score Improvement": "You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Wizard levels 8, 12, and 16.",
      "Level 5: Memorize Spell": "Whenever you finish a Short Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of the level 1+ Wizard spells you have prepared for your Spellcasting feature with another level 1+ spell from the book.",
      "Level 18: Spell Mastery": "You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting time of an action. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of those spells with an eligible spell of the same level from the book.",
      "Level 19: Epic Boon": "You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended.",
      "Level 20: Signature Spells": "Choose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once at level 3 without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't cast them in this way again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot."

    "raw_text": "Source: Player's Handbook\nWizards are defined by their exhaustive study of magic's inner workings. They cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.\nMost Wizards share a scholarly approach to magic. They examine the theoretical underpinnings of magic, particularly the categorization of spells into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built on their studies to invent iconic spells now used across the multiverse.\nThe closest a Wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.\nBut the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.\nCore Wizard Traits\nPrimary Ability\nIntelligence\nHit Point Die\nD6 per Wizard level\nSaving Throw Proficiencies\nIntelligence and Wisdom\nSkill Proficiencies\nChoose 2: Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion\nWeapon Proficiencies\nSimple weapons\nArmor Training\nNone\nStarting Equipment\nChoose A or B: (A) 2 Daggers, Arcane Focus (Quarterstaff), Robe, Spellbook, Scholar's Pack, and 5 GP; or (B) 55 GP\nBecoming a Wizard …\nAs a Level 1 Character\nGain all the traits in the Core Wizard Traits table.\nGain the Wizard's level 1 features, which are listed in the Wizard Features table.\nAs a Multiclass Character\nGain the Hit Point Die from the Core Wizard Traits table.\nGain the Wizard's level 1 features, which are listed in the Wizard Features table.

These features are listed in the Wizard Features table.\nLevel 1: Spellcasting\nAs a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the\nWizard spell list\nlater in the class’s description.\nCantrips.\nYou know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. Light, Mage Hand, and Ray of Frost are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.\nWhen you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table.\nSpellbook.\nYour wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting Identify. You determine the book’s appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.\nThe book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice.\nDetect Magic\n,\nFeather Fall\n,\nMage Armor\n,\nMagic Missile\n,\nSleep\n, and\nThunderwave\nare recommended.\nWhenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.\nSpell Slots.\nThe Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+.\nYou prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.\nIf another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells.\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.\nSpellcasting Ability.\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.\nSpellcasting Focus.\nYou can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.\nExpanding and Replacing a Spellbook\nThe spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you might find other spells during your adventures that you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a Spell Scroll, for example, and then copy it into your spellbook.\nCopying a Spell into the Book.\nWhen you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it’s of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook.\nCopying the Book.\nYou can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell.\nIf you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook.\nLevel 1: Ritual Adept\nYou can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn’t have the spell prepared, but you must read from the book to cast a spell in this way.\nLevel 1: Arcane Recovery\nYou can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if you're a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels’ worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 2: Scholar\nWhile studying magic, you also specialized in another field of study. Choose one of the following skills in which you have proficiency: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion. You have Expertise in the chosen skill.\nLevel 3: Arcane Tradition\nYou gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. The Abjurer, Diviner, Evoker, and Illusionist subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Wizard level or lower.\nWizard Subclasses\nName\nAbjurer\nBladesinger\nDiviner\nEvoker\nIllusionist\nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement\nYou gain the\nAbility Score Improvement feat\nor another\nfeat of your choice\nfor which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Wizard levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 5: Memorize Spell\nWhenever you finish a Short Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of the level 1+ Wizard spells you have prepared for your Spellcasting feature with another level 1+ spell from the book.\nLevel 18: Spell Mastery\nYou have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting time of an action. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of those spells with an eligible spell of the same level from the book.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon\nYou gain an\nEpic Boon feat\nor another feat of your choice for which you qualify.\nBoon of Spell Recall\nis recommended.\nLevel 20: Signature Spells\nChoose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once at level 3 without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't cast them in this way again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.",
